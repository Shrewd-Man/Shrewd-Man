- Hi, I’m @Shrewd-Man
- I’m currently pretty confident in Java, C, and 6502 Assembly, and I'm pretty knowledgeable in Python as well!

- Fun fact: I collect retro game consoles, play music, shoot film photography, and love physics. Most of my programming is low-level nowadays. I started (like most) with Python, and I've been exploring more and more ever since. C caught my attention a while ago and I instantly fell in love with it, and that's now my go-to.
